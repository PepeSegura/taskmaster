-Logging system [DONE]
-Sighup reloads config but not processes [DONE]
-Control shell with at least:
    - status [DONE]
    - start /stop /restart  [DONE]
    - reload config [DONE]
    - stop supervisor [DONE]

TO DO:

    - Autorestart with start time start retries [DONE]


CHECK:
    - Stop time waits even if program succesfully stops. [DONE]

    - Parser corner cases:
        -no cmd -> errors and exits
        -no numprocs -> errors and exits
        -no autorestart -> errors and exits
        -no autostart -> autostart=false
        -no exitcodes -> provide at least one or exit
        -no starttime -> starttime=0
        -no start retries -> doesnt retry
        -no stopsignal -> invalid (maybe default to sigterm)
        -no stoptime  -> stoptime=0
        -no stdout/stderr -> defaults to terminal stdout/stderr
        -no env -> same env we get (env=current)
        -no workdir -> same workdir we get (workdir=current)
        -no umask -> sets it to 000
